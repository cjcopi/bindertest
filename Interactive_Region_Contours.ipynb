    "# Interactive Region Contours\n",
    "\n",
    "For the compact orientable manifolds $E_2$ through $E_5$ we can determine what fraction of observers in these inhomogeneous spaces would see circles for given topology scales.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main idea is that an observer will see circles in the CMB if their nearest clone is nearer than the diameter of the last scattering surface. Measuring distances in terms of this diameter, this means circles are seen if the nearest clone is less than 1 unit of distance away.\n",
    "\n",
    "In $E_2$-$E_5$ we can restrict our study to points in the $xy$-plane. Further, the regions in the $xy$-plane will be circles with some radii. Finally, all the spaces (except $E_2$) are described by two lengths, $L_A$ and $L_B$, and we will only consider the special case of $E_2$ which has a square base, i.e., it is also described by two lengths.\n",
    "\n",
    "Determining the locations and radii is often not hard. The challenging part is calculating the area of the points that would see CMB circles compared to the total area. The difficulty is that the circles may overlap. Exactly when/how they overlap depends on the lengths.\n",
    "\n",
    "To overcome this, we instead construct the circles, take the union of them, and allow `shapely` to do the hard work.\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic algorithm is as follows:\n",
    "1. Construct a \"base domain\". It is the base in the $xy$-plane that, up to symmetries, restricts the extent of the space we need to consider. We can typically restrict this to a triangular region.\n",
    "2. For a given length scale $L_A$ and radius parameter $r$, determine the location and radii of all the circles.\n",
    "3. Construct these circles, take their union, intersect it with the base domain, and finally calculate the ratio of areas of the base domain and the union of circles. This is the fraction of observers that would see circles.\n",
    "4. Let $p$ be the desired fraction that we want to allow to see circles. Find the value of $r$ that corresponds to this fraction. From this, calculate the vertical length scale $L_B$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The end result is that we know $L_B(L_A, p)$."
